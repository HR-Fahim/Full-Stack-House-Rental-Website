# Project Features

This project incorporates several key features that were showcased during the initial project review class. The following features were demonstrated:

1. **Login using Firebase Authentication**: The project utilizes Firebase Authentication to provide a secure and reliable login system. Users can create an account and log in using their credentials, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the application.

2. **Sign up with Firebase Real-time Database**: The sign-up process stores user data in the Firebase Real-time Database. When a user registers for an account, their information, such as username, email, and other relevant details, is securely stored in the database for future reference.

3. **Voice Input Fields**: One of the notable aspects of this project is the incorporation of voice input fields. Users can utilize voice commands to interact with the application instead of relying solely on manual input. This feature enhances user experience and provides an alternative input method for convenience.

These features collectively contribute to the functionality and user experience of the project, making it more secure, interactive, and accessible.
