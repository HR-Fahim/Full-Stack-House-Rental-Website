# Software Requirements Specification

SRS stands for Software Requirements Specification. It is a comprehensive document that describes the requirements, functionalities, and constraints of a software system. The SRS serves as a communication tool between stakeholders, including clients, project managers, developers, and testers, to ensure a shared understanding of the system to be developed.

The SRS typically includes the following sections:

1. Introduction: Provides an overview of the software system, its purpose, and the intended audience.

2. System Overview: Describes the system's high-level architecture, components, and interactions with external systems.

3. Functional Requirements: Specifies the system's functionalities, including use cases, user interactions, input/output data, and expected behavior.

4. Non-functional Requirements: Defines the system's qualities, constraints, and performance expectations, such as reliability, scalability, security, and usability.

5. User Interface: Describes the visual and interactive aspects of the system, including screen layouts, navigation, and user input validation.

6. System Interfaces: Specifies the interfaces with external systems, hardware devices, APIs, and databases.

7. Data Requirements: Describes the data structures, database schemas, data flow, and data validation rules.

8. Constraints: Includes any limitations or restrictions imposed on the system, such as hardware or software compatibility requirements.

9. Assumptions and Dependencies: States any assumptions made during the requirements gathering process and the dependencies on external factors.

10. Appendices: Contains additional information, diagrams, or supporting documents, such as use case diagrams, class diagrams, or sequence diagrams.

The SRS serves as a foundation for the software development process, guiding the design, implementation, and testing phases. It ensures that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system's requirements and provides a reference for evaluating the system's compliance with the specified requirements.
